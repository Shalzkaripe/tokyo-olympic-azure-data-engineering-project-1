# Data Engineering 2021 Tokyo Olympics Project
 
## Overview

This project aims to analyze Olympic data using various tools and technologies, including Azure Data Factory, Data Lake Gen 2, Synapse Analytics, and Azure Databricks.

## Project Goals

- Data Ingestion: Build a mechanism is to ingest data from Github.
- ETL System: We are getting data in raw format, transforming this data into the proper format.
- Data lake: We will be getting data from multiple sources so we need centralized repo to store them.
- Cloud: We canâ€™t process vast amounts of data on our local computer so we need to use the cloud, in this case, we will use Azure.
- Reporting: Build a dashboard to get answers to the questions.

## Services we will be using

- Aure: Azure is a cloud computing platform offering services for building, deploying, and managing applications globally.
- Azure Data Factory: A cloud-based data integration service that orchestrates and automates data movement and transformation.
- Azure Data Lake Gen 2: A scalable, secure data storage service optimized for big data analytics.
- Azure Databricks: An analytics platform for big data and machine learning, built on Apache Spark.
- Azure Synapse Analytics: A unified analytics platform for big data and data warehousing.
- Power BI: A business analytics tool for interactive visualizations and data-driven insights.
